## Commentary
Although this errs more on the side of cybersecurity, I think this article says a lot about how simple oversights when developing software can lead to vulnerabilities as un-complex as entering an employee email, but with implications as large as constant location tracking and even unlocking a car remotely (!!!). It's an important insight into the weight that software engineering can carry and a reminder to be thorough and thoughtful when developing software. Also, it's pretty fascinating that someone thought it was a good idea to leave a password-reset API endpoint open that needed zero authentication - an issue that would likely have been avoided if the team was in good communication and audited each others' work.


### Forked Commentary: Wyatt Destabelle
Like Isaac said, this article was very light hearted in tone, but still was an excellent example of why thourgh, reviewable work is critical in software development- particularly when this work is security related. I personally felt deeply uncomfortable with the amount of information Subaru collected and then had easily accessable for any employee, but I suppose this is just par for the course in the modern world.
