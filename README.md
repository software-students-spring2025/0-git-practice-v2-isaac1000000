Although this errs more on the side of cybersecurity, I think this article says a lot about how simple oversights when developing software can lead to vulnerabilities as un-complex as entering an employee email, but with implications as large as constant location tracking and even unlocking a car remotely (!!!). It's an important insight into the weight that software engineering can carry and a reminder to be thorough and thoughtful when developing software. Also, it's pretty fascinating that someone thought it was a good idea to leave a password-reset API endpoint open that needed zero authentication - an issue that would likely have been avoided if the team was in good communication and audited each others' work.
